{-| Utilities to securely read in user passwords from standard input.

    All the programs in the Suns suite do not accept any passwords as command
    line arguments because process listings like @ps@ would leak passwords
    passed this way.

    To securely automate these programs, store the password a single line in a
    file with appropriate permissions and feed the file to the program's
    standard input like this:

> $ suns-server < password.txt

    The only way to obtain a value of type 'Password' is to use the 'password'
    function.  This allows functions to demand an argument of type 'Password'
    if they want to ensure that their argument safely originates from the
    'password' function.

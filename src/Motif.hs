{-| Given 'MotifGraphs' and a 'Structure', find as many matches to all motifs,
    allowing multiple matches of each motif, but forbidding overlapping bonds.

    The outer 'V.Vector' of the result has one element per motif, and the inner
    'V.Vector' stores the return values of all of the successful matches of that
    motif.  Suns only uses 'ParseS' where the @match@ return value has type
    @Vector Int@, representing a list of matched atom indices, so the result
    type will end up being @Vector (Vector (Vector Int))@.  The reason I don't
    specialize the type and keep @match@ polymorphic is to improve the clarity
    of the type signature and to use parametricity to guard against potential
    errors.

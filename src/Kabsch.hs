{-| Aligns a list of structures, represented as @(pdbID, substructure, full)@,
    where:

    * @pdbID@: A placeholder for the structure's PDB ID

    * @substructure@: The subset of the structure to align on

    * @full@: The full structure to return, aligned along the given substructure

    The first argument of the tuple is an arbitrarily chosen substructure that
    every other substructure will align to.  Just use the first substructure.

    All substructures must have the same number of atoms.  This precondition is
    not checked.

    The result is the aligned full structures, paired with their PDB ID and the
    RMSD of the alignment.

    The types and tuples are chosen to simplify interfacing with the internal
    code in the "Search" module.

{-| Fast serialization and deserialization specialized to 'Handle's.  The \'H\'
    in 'HSerialize' stands for 'Handle'

    I do not use @binary@ or @cereal@ because they were both really slow the
    last time I checked.  So I wrote a serialization interface specialized to
    interacting with 'Handle's in 'IO'.  This improved performance 5-fold the
    last time I measured it, but those libraries may have improved since then si
    this solution may be obsolete.
